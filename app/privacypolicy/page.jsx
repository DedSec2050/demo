              (EEA).
              <br />
              Countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) do not
              always offer the same levels of protection to your personal data,
              so European law has prohibited transfers of personal data outside
              of the EEA unless the transfer meets certain criteria.
              <br />
              Many of our third parties service providers are based outside the
              European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal
              data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
              <br />
              Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we do our
              best to ensure a similar degree of security of data by ensuring at
              least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
              <br />
              Our Online course platform Zenler provider based in the UK is our
              data processor and we have entered into data processing agreement
              for the processor to protect your personal data. We will only
              transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to
              provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the
              European Commission; or Where we use certain service providers, we
              may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification
              mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal
              data the same protection it has in Europe; or Where we use
              providers based in the United States, we may transfer data to them
              if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them
              to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the
              Europe and the US. Where we use providers based in the United
              States (for example Amazon, Sendgrid) we may transfer data to them
              where we have signed data processing addendums for the provider to
              provide protection of data shared between the Europe and the US.
              <br />
              If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your
              explicit consent to the specific transfer. You will have the right
              to withdraw this consent at any time.

              fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the
              purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting
              requirements.
              <br />
              When deciding what the correct time is to keep the data for we
              look at its amount, nature and sensitivity, potential risk of harm
              from unauthorized use or disclosure, the processing purposes, if
              these can be achieved by other means and legal requirements.

              about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and
              Transaction Data) for six years after they stop being customers.
              <br />

              research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this

              this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
