      "What is CISSP Computerized Adaptive Test and how does this work?",
    ans: (
      <>
        CISSP exam has almost moved away from linier exam patterns for most of
        the locations. A computerized adaptive test works on the basis of a
        backend algorithm which cumulatively evaluates your estimated
        proficiency level at each response from you. Which Questions you will be
        tested on is decided dynamically by the algorithm in realtime. Here is
        how the exam criteria work:<br></br>
        <br />
        1. <b>Confidence Interval Rule:</b> Once you reach 100 Questions, if the
        estimated proficiency score is above 95%, you shall be declared pass. If
        you score below 70%, the criteria will close the screen and you will be
        declared as FAIL.
        <br />
        <br />
        2. <b>Maximum Length Exam Rule:</b> If your score is between the passing
        baseline of 70% and below the Estimated Proficiency level of 95%, you
        have to face an additional 50 Operational questions. During this time,
        if at any point your score goes below the passing baseline of 70%, you
        shall be declared as Fail. However, if you are able to complete all 50
        questions and maintain a score above the passing baseline, you will be
        declared as PASS. <br />
        <br />
        3. <b>Run-Out-of-Time Rule:</b> If you do not complete 150 questions
        withing the stipulated 3 Hours, you shall automatically be declared FAIL
